**Welcome**!  School attendance boundaries impact _where_
children go to school and _who_ they go to school with, affecting their learning environments by influencing how likely they are to encounter peers from different backgrounds.
Redrawing attendance boundaries could increase school diversity, but it could also be disruptive for students, raising the question of which kinds of boundary changes are "worth it".

To help you weigh the possible benefits and costs of changing elementary school attendance boundaries, weâ€™ve created a computer program that automatically generates different boundary options.  These options show how much diversity might increase across elementary schools, and what might be required in terms of changes to travel times and student-school assignments to achieve these gains.
