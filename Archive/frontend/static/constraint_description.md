<!-- The computer program’s ${ATTEMPT_DESCRIPTION} for ${DISTRICT} would
increase the probability of exposure for ${CATEGORY} to
students of different backgrounds from ${EXPOSURE_PROB_BASELINE} to ${EXPOSURE_PROB_NEW}
on average across schools.
If we estimate each student to befriend
${EXPOSURE_BASELINE_NUM_STUDENTS} new students each year, this
increase could translate into an estimated
${EXPOSURE_ADDITIONAL_STUDENTS} additional friendships between
people who are ${CATEGORY} and people who are not ${CATEGORY} across the district.
Achieving this increase would require
approximately ${SCHOOL_SWITCH_PERCENT} of students in the district to switch schools, and these
families, on average, would experience a ${TRAVEL_INCREASE_MINUTES}-minute change in their
travel time to school (each way).

To generate this configuration, the computer program factored in a
variety of constraints, and also explored different ways of
formulating its overall goal.  The redrawing described above
represents one of ${NUM_CONFIGS} possible configurations generated for
this district.  You can use the dropdowns below to explore
configurations based on different constraints and goals imposed by the
program.  Hovering over the “?” icon next to each dropdown will give
more information about each of these values.
