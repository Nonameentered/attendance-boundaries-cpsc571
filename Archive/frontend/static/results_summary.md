<!-- Our ${ATTEMPT_DESCRIPTION} for ${DISTRICT} would
increase chances for diverse encounters between ${CATEGORY} and non-${CATEGORY} by an average of ${EXPOSURE_PROB_RELATIVE_CHANGE} across schools.
This means that if we estimate each student to befriend
${EXPOSURE_BASELINE_NUM_STUDENTS} new students each year, there could be approximately 
${EXPOSURE_ADDITIONAL_STUDENTS} additional friendships between
${CATEGORY} and non-${CATEGORY} across the district.
Achieving this increase would require around
${SCHOOL_SWITCH_PERCENT} of students to switch schools and experience an average change of ${TRAVEL_INCREASE_MINUTES} minutes in their
travel time to school each way. -->

<!-- We estimate our ${ATTEMPT_DESCRIPTION} for ${DISTRICT} could help foster 
${EXPOSURE_ADDITIONAL_STUDENTS} additional friendships between
${CATEGORY} and non-${CATEGORY} across the district (assuming each student befriends
${EXPOSURE_BASELINE_NUM_STUDENTS} other students at school every year). The school experiencing the most change would see a ${MAX_EXPOSURE_PROB_RELATIVE_CHANGE} 
change in the chances that ${CATEGORY} encounter non-${CATEGORY} at school.
Achieving these changes would require around ${SCHOOL_SWITCH_PERCENT} of 
students to switch schools and experience an average change of

According to our data, ${CAT_DISTRICT_PERCENT} of elementary school students in ${DISTRICT} are classified as ${CATEGORY}, 
but they are concentrated in ${NUM_OVER_CONC_SCHOOLS} out of ${NUM_TOTAL_SCHOOLS} elementary schools where an average of ${AVG_CONC_STATUS_QUO} are ${CATEGORY}.  Implementing the boundary changes below could change the average percentage of ${CATEGORY} at these schools from ${AVG_CONC_STATUS_QUO} to ${AVG_CONC_NEW}, with ${MAX_CHANGING_SCHOOL} experiencing the greatest change from ${MAX_CHANGING_PRE} to ${MAX_CHANGING_POST}.  These changes would require about ${SCHOOL_SWITCH_PERCENT} of students across the district to switch schools and experience an average change of ${TRAVEL_INCREASE_MINUTES} minutes in their travel time to school each way.
