Requires blocks that are currently contiguous with respect to their assigned schools remain so.  We define a block to be contiguous with respect to its assigned school if you can draw a line from it to the school without going through any blocks zoned for other schools.  Blocks that are "islands" in the original zoning (i.e., those that do not satisfy the above definition of contiguous) can continue to remain islands in the rezoning, but don't have to. Due to geographic precision of the underlying datasets, sometimes blocks may be counted as islands when they may not be considered as such by the school district.  Unchecking this box allows for a greater range of rezonings that may increase school diversity more, but at the expense of less contiguous boundaries.
